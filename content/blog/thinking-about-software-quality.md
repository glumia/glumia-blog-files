I found myself thinking about software quality this morning.

Quality as in reliable software you can depend on.

Life is complex, we all have tons of things to worry about, and our software
not working as it's supposed to shouldn't be one of those.

Error handling, thinking about what could go wrong, trying to recover, retrying,
or, ultimately, letting users know about the error in a way they can understand and act
on, are things that we often overlook.

I could spend some words about programming languages and how they do not help on that
front (I am looking at you Python), but I'll not get into that argument as I think
this is more of a symptom than a cause.

The causes are probably diverse and complex, but I think we should start by
caring more.

I do want to build software that people can rely on and I'll keep pushing to regain
my and people's trust in software.
