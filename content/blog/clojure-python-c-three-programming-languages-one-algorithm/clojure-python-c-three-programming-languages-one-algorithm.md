Too lazy to write something now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

Just a bit disappointed by how bad Clojure's performance are (but hey, 
immutability is not free!) and by how damn difficult it is to improve them 
(yeah, I looked at transients but they would require me to write procedural 
code in a functional language...).
